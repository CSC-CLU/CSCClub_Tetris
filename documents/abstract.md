# Abstract for Festival of Scholars

As computer scientists, much of our time is spent studying the software side of computers, but considering the hardware is also essential to the study and practice of computer science. All parts of the hardware must be designed and connected correctly, and the software at the low level must have the ability to read signals from, interpret, and send signals to the hardware, such as when a button is pressed or when a light should be triggered. We don't usually spend much time considering these things, as most everything we work with is designed to consider them for us, allowing us to focus on the high level concepts of application functionality rather than questions of how to even get input from the user. In order to study how all the parts of a computer system work together, the Computer Science Club has created a project from start to finish, including hardware, input and output devices, and software (programmed in C++, which is not part of the required curriculum at CLU). Our wired circuits, communication standards, and code have largely been created from scratch, all to implement an otherwise-simple game: Tetris.
